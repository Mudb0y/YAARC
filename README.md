Yet another accessible Reddit client

## Why?

Just because I can.

Also, it's fun and I want another project to work on.

I suppose the main reason though is a lack of an RFB like client for anything other than Windows, and I love RFB so I'll clone it my self.

## Concept

This is supposed to be a concept-clone of Reddit For Blind, which in my experience is the fastest way to browse Reddit with a screen-reader.

On top of the basic features you'd expect from a Reddit client, I'm planning on potentially adding more features such as chat integration, native video playback support, and more.
